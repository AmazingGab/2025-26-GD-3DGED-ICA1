## Narrative Summary

"DEAR SOBER me" is a short, single room investigative game as required for the brief.

The player wakes up after a blackout in an unfamiliar room with no memory on how they ended up there. A note addressing to their sober self apologises for the night and hints at unsettling experience the drunk self had.

You examine objects, collecting scattered belongings and polaroid pictures with some notes on them. Using such clues the player can reconstruct the events of the night. The more they find the more new interactions are available. To free yourself from the room you have to un-barricade the door and leave behind a reminder about drinking responsibly and their consequences.

## Audio Design

The music has two states:

- Confusion stage where the music emphasis that emotion
- Calm stage where the player finally calmed down and just investigating what happened.

There is many SFX in the game:

- Examine, Collect, Activate, Use
- Self Talk to add more personality
- Headache (intense sound just for the person themselves to briefly feel it)
- Door knocking being the starting point

I added two spatial exterior ambiences which can be heard occasionally like the cars beeping and the birds chirping.

## Camera Behaviour

There is a standard non colliding camera for the player to explore the map with. I tried physics and unfortunately spent so much time that it was better to go with this.

There is the examination mode where the camera is frozen and item it put closer for the player to see.

There will also be camera curve of the player waking up out of the bed.
